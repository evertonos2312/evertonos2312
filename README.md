### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

After years of experience in the logistics field, I decided to pursue my passion for technology and started studying Analysis and Systems Development at college. Since then, I have been dedicated to advancing my career in this field and constantly seeking new knowledge and ways to stay updated.


### ðŸš€ Expertise
Currently, I am part of the marketing team at Contmatic Phoenix, where I work on backend solution development. It is a challenging job that constantly stimulates me to expand my knowledge and skills. I use modern technologies such as PHP 8 and Laravel 10 to develop high-performance and quality solutions that meet market demands.
